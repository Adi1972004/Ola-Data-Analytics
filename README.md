## ðŸŽ¯ SQL Analysis Tasks
The SQL scripts create **views** and queries to answer 10 business questions:

1. Retrieve all successful bookings  
2. Find the average ride distance for each vehicle type  
3. Get the total number of cancelled rides by customers  
4. List the top 5 customers who booked the highest number of rides  
5. Get the number of rides cancelled by drivers due to personal and car-related issues  
6. Find the maximum and minimum driver ratings for Prime Sedan bookings  
7. Retrieve all rides where payment was made using UPI  
8. Find the average customer rating per vehicle type  
9. Calculate the total booking value of rides completed successfully  
10. List all incomplete rides along with the reason  

ðŸ“‚ **File:** `Ola_SQL_query.sql` contains all the SQL scripts.
